<b>These are all the Mac OS Classic themes that I made in years past.</b><br>
<font size="-1">Compatible with Mac OS 8.5 - 9.2.2.  Kaleidoscope NOT required.</font><br><br>

To see how I made these themes, visit <a href="./theme_hack/index.html">this page</a>.  It describes all of the details I found by experimenting with each type of resource in the Macintosh resource forks of themes.

<tr><td valign="top">
<a href="./theme_hack/AquaMaXes.sit">
<img src="./themes/icon_aquamax.png" border="0"></a></td>
<td valign="top">AquaMaX</td>
<td valign="top"><font size="-1">AquaMaX makes your Mac look much like it has Mac OS X.  This is the best Mac OS X theme availble.</font></td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top">
<a href="./theme_hack/Doohickey2.sit">
<img src="./themes/icon_doohickey.gif" border="0"></a></td>
<td valign="top">Doohickey <b><i>2.0</i></b></td>
<td valign="top"><font size="-1">Doohickey is a goofy theme that looks similar to Apple's beta-released "Gizmo" theme and it shows off some things that themes can do that can't be done in Kaleidoscope.  I finally finished this theme after it sat unfinished for a very long time.  If you play around enough, you will discover some very interesting functionality.</font></td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top">
<a href="./theme_hack/DSX.sit">
<img src="./themes/icon_dsx.png" border="0"></a></td>
<td valign="top">Classic DSX</td>
<td valign="top"><font size="-1">Classic DSX was relatively easy for me to create from the existing Mac OS X theme.  Because I made AquaMaX so accurate, I was pretty much able to just copy the images over.  Very few layout changes needed to be made.  Much of my time was used converting images with transparency masks (nearly ALL of them) into opaque images, and trying to maintain the original transparent look.</font></td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top">
<a href="./theme_hack/Moby.sit">
<img src="./themes/icon_moby.gif" border="0"></a></td>
<td valign="top">Moby</td>
<td valign="top"><font size="-1">Moby is a theme like no other.  It has BeOS-style windows, and everything is a bizarre organic shade of green.  The menus have a stretching gradient background, something not generally thought of as being possible to do.  To this day, I use this theme in the Classic environment of my Mac OS X system.</font></td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top">
<a href="./theme_hack/Sosumi.sit">
<img src="./themes/icon_sosumi.png" border="0"></a></td>
<td valign="top">Classic&nbsp;Sosumi</td>
<td valign="top"><font size="-1">Sosumi is similar to DSX in that it is based on a Mac OS X theme.  Likewise, I made very few layout changes.  If you want to convert a Mac OS X theme into a classic theme, this would be the theme to choose because it has extremely organized resources.</font></td></tr>
