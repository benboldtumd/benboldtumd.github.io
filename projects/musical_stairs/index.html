Apparently people ask why The Works doesn't have musical stairs.  THAT CAN NOT GO ON FOREVER, I'm determined.  Because I too have come to expect sound effects when I go up and down stairs.<br>
<br>
It's not something that's actually being planned or anything, but I thought I'd work on a sensor.  The ones we're used to have a single infrared tripwire.  I am working on a design that uses two red (visible) tripwires and the time period between the tripping of the two should be an indication of how much of a stomp has occurred.  This information could translate into sound velocity, or maybe harmonics or some other nifty thing that would make ours stand out from other musical stairs just a little bit.<br>
<br>
This is more of an R & D project.  Right now I need to focus on the sensor curtain and other projects.
