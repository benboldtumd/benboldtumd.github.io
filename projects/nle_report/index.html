</center>

I took an engineering writing class in Spring 2009.  This class centered around a group project in which we researched and reported on the feasibility of the Northern Lights Express project, a real project being designed to connect Duluth to the Twin Cities via a commuter rail system.<br><br>

From the paper,<br>
<blockquote><table border="1" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="10" bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><tr><td>"We have conducted a study of the proposed Northern Lights Express rail line. The Northern Lights Express is a train of the future. We think it is important to be as modern as possible. It is not worth spending millions of dollars on technology of the twentieth century for a twenty-first century project.<br><br>
This study was conducted to investigate the factors that would make this a popular rail line. With more ridership the rail line will prosper to the point that it can be considered a success. Our main points of transit time and fuel efficiency are two factors that will maximize ridership by saving passengers time and money."</td></tr></table></blockquote><br>

We developed the following Gantt chart at the beginning of the semester to keep on track:<br><br>
