What kinds of students could ever expect to call themselves <i>"graduates"</i> without building a Jacob's ladder, or some similar lightning bolt machine?  Well, I'm not one of those people.  The design is simple, the effect is awesome.<br><br>

I acquired a very large neon sign transformer from an auto parts store via eBay.  Apparently they had gotten a new sign on the front of their store.  This beast takes a standard 110V AC input and steps it up to 12,000V and a terrifying 60mA.  That means the arc is about 720W.<br><br>

If you look closely, you can see that my steel wires start moving around from the electromagnetic forces being produced!  Watch the show!<br><br>
