<b>What happened to Boldt 24-Pack?</b><br><br>

Boldt 24-Pack was a series of packages of software instruments that contained freely available SoundFonts from the internet.  As stated in the original documentation, the primary sources of SoundFonts for these packages were:<br><br>

<a href="http://www.hammersound.net/">http://www.hammersound.net/</a><br>
<a href="http://www.sf2midi.com/">http://www.sf2midi.com/</a><br><br>

Boldt 24-Pack accepted donations for its purpose - the conversion of these instruments to EXS-24 to run in GarageBand and Logic.  Boldt 24-Pack has become obsolete with the advent of <a href="http://sonicamigos.com/polyphonticsgb/">PolyPhontics GB</a>.  Please consider using this 3rd party converter to hand-pick your own collection of SoundFonts.
