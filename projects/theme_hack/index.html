That image can then be put into a "frame", similar to how a real picture can be put into a picture frame.  A frame is a 1-pixel wide border around the main image.  In that frame, you can put more "plut" images into all of the new pixels around the border.<br><br>The thing that makes frames so functional is that the parts that will change size in the theme are in the middles of the top, left, bottom, and right sides.  So if you put images in those 4 areas that look good when stretched out, the frame will look great.  This also allows you to make the corners look however you want, and they will never be stretched.  Just the middle stretches.<br><br>Just one frame of pixels isn't suited for many things, so that's why you can add more frames.  So, there has to be a way to tell the Mac where to put the extra frames.  Frame 0 is the main frame.  Frame 1 is just inside by 1 pixel, frame 2 is inside by 2 pixels, and so on.  BUT, frame -1 is OUTSIDE the main frame by one pixel and frame -2 is outside by 2 pixels and so on.  Use as many frames as necessary to make the super-cool stretchable image you want.<br><br><br><center><a name=LAYO><font size="+2">layo</font><br><table width="75%"><tr><td><b><font size="-1"><center>The "layo" (short for Layout) resource is the backbone of the theme.  It tells everything where to go.</center></font></b></td></tr></table><br></center>The 2 main parts to the "layo" resource are the Coordinate Entries and the Item Entries.<br><br><b>The Coordinate Entry.</b>The Coordinate Entry defines custom boundaries for the Item Entries later in the resource.  All of these entries must first have a Reference.  This can either be a default setting or the number of a different Coordinate Entry.  From there, you must fill in an offset for the reference.  For example, If I wanted make a top boundary to use for an Item Entry (below) that was 3 pixels below the default top boundary, I would enter Default Top as the reference, and 3 for the offset.  If I was going ABOVE default top by 3 pixels, though, it would be an offset of -3.  Offsets get bigger the closer you get to the bottom right corner, just like the longer you read this webpage, the closer you get to the bottom, right corner.<br><br>There is also a second part of each Coordinate Entry that is actually a <i>second</i>, backup boundary.  The reason you would want to have a backup boundary would be to limit the first boundary to the second boundary.  For example, if there was ever a window that was so small that there wasn't enough room for the zoom button, normally the zoom button would hang off the right side of the window if it was not limited to the right side of the window.  So, if you wanted to limit it to the right side of the window, you would put in the info for the right side of the window as the second Coordinate Reference and Offset, and you would choose either Squash (Constrain-to) or Disappear (Collapse-to) as the second (backup) coordinate type.  Disappear will make the any Item entries referring to it disappear completely.  Squash will simply push the boundary to make the Item Entry's space smaller.<br><br>The last part of the Coordinate Entry is the FIRST Coordinate Type.  This can be set to Variable to get special boundaries directly from the Mac or to Average.  Average finds the center between the 1st and 2nd references and makes that the boundary.<br><br>Just one thing that you must remember:  DO NOT mix vertical and horizontal boundaries.  It will just cause the layo not to work at all.<br><br><b>The Item Entry.</b>The Item Entry's job is to link to an image somewhere else in the theme, give it special functions, and tell it where to go.  There is a massive list of settings that you can turn on or off at the beginning of the Item Entry.  I don't see a need to explain them, because they are very self-explanatory.  After the list of settings, there are 4 coordinate references for the top, left, bottom, and right boundaries.  You can enter the specific number of a coordinate from above OR you can select a default setting.<br><br>Next is the image reference area.  Choose the type of image (sometimes called "component") you want, then enter it's info.  For pxm#, the index is the ID of the image inside the "pxm#" resource you want to use.  The first image is ID 0, the second is ID 1, etc.<br><br><br><center><a name=PLUT><font size="+2">plut</font><br><table width="75%"><tr><td><b><font size="-1"><center>The "plut" (short for Color Pixel Pattern Look Up Table) resource is a simple resource that defines colors and links to "<a href="./theme_hack/index.html#PPAT">ppat</a>" resources.</center></font></b></td></tr></table><br><br><a name=PPAT><font size="+2">ppat</font><br><table width="75%"><tr><td><b><font size="-1"><center>The "ppat" (short for Color Pixel Pattern) resource is an image resource.</center></font></b></td></tr></table><br><br><a name=PXM><font size="+2">pxm#</font><br><table width="75%"><tr><td><b><font size="-1"><center>The "pxm#" (short for Pixmap List) resource is a maskable, multi-image image resource.</center></font></b></td></tr></table><br><br><a name=SCEN><font size="+2">scen</font><br><table width="75%"><tr><td><b><font size="-1"><center>The "scen" (short for Theme Scenario) resource gives the theme a Theme entry in the first tab of the Appearance control panel.</center></font></b></td></tr></table><br>

Have the user brushes window open, click the brush you want to use, and click an area of the Frame to fill it in with that brush.  To make an area transparent, apply the same brush to an area twice.  The colored pencils do not work; they all act as the black pencil, which is aligned top-left.  You must use Resorcerer and the Theme Templates to change alignments.<br><br><center><b><a href="http://www.Mathemaesthetics.com">Resorcerer</a> and the Theme TemplatesOR<br><a href="http://www.zathras.de/programming/my_applications.php">Resurrection</a> and the <a href="./theme_hack/themetemplates.rsrc.sit">Resurrection Theme Templates</a></b></center><br>In Resorcerer, each frame is represented by an item entry.  They are extremely hard to edit this way, but there are many added options, such as adding the frames between 0 and 1 and 0 and -1, which are often just gaps in Theme Machine.  You can also choose the alignment of the brushes in comparison to the frame's boundaries.  There are a few other options that I haven't experimented with, too.<br><br><br><center><a name=LAYO2><font size="+2">layo</font><br><b><a href="http://www.Mathemaesthetics.com">Resorcerer</a> and the Theme TemplatesOR<br><a href="http://www.zathras.de/programming/my_applications.php">Resurrection</a> and the <a href="./theme_hack/themetemplates.rsrc.sit">Resurrection Theme Templates</a></b></center><br>This template makes it so easy that it doesn't need an explanation.<br><br><center><b><a href="http://download.info.apple.com/Apple_Support_Area/Apple_Software_Updates/English-North_American/Macintosh/Utilities/ResEdit_2.1.3.sea.bin">ResEdit</a></b></center><br>In ResEdit, you must edit the layo resources through hex because it is not powerful enough to drive the Resorcerer layo template.  This is a replacement, of sorts, for the template.  The example contains 2 coordinate entries and 2 item entries.<br><br><center><img src="./theme_hack/layohexedit.gif" height="204" width="276"></center><br><br>The BLUE area at the very top starts out with 3 groups of numbers that are always all zeros.  The last group of numbers tells how many coordinate entries there are.  REMEMBER TO ALWAYS HAVE THIS RIGHT.<br><br>The MAGENTA and YELLOW areas are the 2 separate coordinate entries.  Each consists of 8 groups of hex numbers.<ul><li>Group 1: Coordinate Type (Use 0000 for Standard, 0001 for Variable, and 0002 for Average.)</li><li>Group 2: Offset from Reference (next)</li><li>Group 3: Reference (Can be the number of another coordinate, FFFF for Default Top, FFFE for Default Left, FFFD for Default Bottom, or FFFC for Default Right.)</li><li>Group 4: Backup Coordinate Type (Use 0000 to skip backup coordinate, 0001 for Squashing, 0002 for Disappearing, and 0003 for the mysterious "Size-O-Matic")</li><li>Group 5: Offset from 2nd Reference (next)</li><li>Group 6: 2nd Reference (Can be the number of another coordinate, FFFF for Default Top, FFFE for Default Left, FFFD for Default Bottom, or FFFC for Default Right.)</li><li>Group 7: always 0000</li><li>Group 8: always 0000</li></ul>The GREEN area tells how many item entries there are.

In other words, type it over in the right column.  If you are referring to a "frme" resource, those brilliant guys down at Apple misspelled it, so you need to too.  Enter "fram" for frame resources.  Also, if you have an item entry that does not need an image (such as text), enter "NULL".  Your other options are "pxm#" and "plut".  "ppat" is NOT an option; you must refer to a "plut" that refers to a "ppat" in order to use the "ppat" type of image.<br><br>The BLACK area tells info about the image resource.<ul><li>The first group of numbers is the hex version of the ID number of the image.</li><li>The second group of numbers is the image alignment.  For "frme" images, always put in 0001.  For items without images, put in 0000.  For "pxm#" and "plut" resources, put in 0001 for Top-Left alignment, 0002 for Top-Right, 0003 for Bottom-Left, and 0004 for Bottom-Right.</li><li>The third group of numbers is the pixmap image number to use.  As stated on the About the Resources page, this is 0-based, so if you wanted the 5th image in a pixmap, you would enter 0004.  It's just always one less.</li></ul>The BROWN area at the bottom is a second item entry.<br><br>The resource abruptly stops after the last item entry.

You double-click solid colors to change them.  The solid color can be overtaken by a ppat resource if you enter the ppat's ID number.  If you don't want to use a ppat, enter 0 where it asks for a ppat ID and it will use the solid color.  Added note:  Sometimes the solid colors are still used even if there is a ppat in the "Required Brushes" plut, which ID 386.<br><br><center><b>Theme Machine</b></center><br>The plut resources are referred to as "Brushes" in Theme Machine.  To edit a brush, double-click it.  Paste in an image to assign or replace that brush's ppat.  Theme Machine automatically creates the ppat resource and updates the tdat resource, things that need to be done manually in Resorcerer.  Theme Machine makes a mess inside the theme, though, and you loose the labels you may have on the ppat resources.  The ppat's IDs also change to seemingly random numbers.  If there is any sort of previous problem, such as a plut with an assigned ppat that DOESN'T EXIST, or the existing ppat NOT HAVING A tdat ENTRY, Theme Machine will almost certainly "unexpectedly" quit every time on the same brush.<br><br>

I recommend clicking the 32-bit radio button on the bottom left corner.<br><br><center><b><a href="./theme_hack/pixie.sit">Pixie</a></b></center><br>To use Pixie, which I prefer over Theme Machine, you must first line up all your images that you want in a specific pxm#, one right after another, in a graphics app like Photoshop.  Then put the mask exactly on the left side.  If there is a mask for each image, put all of the masks, in order, on the left of the images.  (Only a few things work with a mask for each image, for example the chasing arrows.)  Please note that using Pixie requires you to have ALL of the images for that pxm#, not just the ones you want to replace.<br><br>Next you select the whole thing in your graphics app perfectly, hit copy, and then open Pixie.  Type in the number of images you have, the number of masks (usually 1), the bit depth (always use 32 for the best quality), and the clut ID (it's irrelevant if you use 32-bit, so just put in a number.  I use 0 to minimize confusion.)<br><br>From here, open up the saved file from pixie in ResEdit or Resorcerer and copy the pxm# resource over the old one on your theme.<br><br><br><center><a name=SCEN2><font size="+2">scen</font><br><b><a href="http://www.Mathemaesthetics.com">Resorcerer</a> and the Resorcerer Theme Templates</b></center><br>Extremely similar to editing the tinf resource.
